# Myopia Classifier

This is part of the Associate Data Analyst course by NTUC LearningHub. This project uses Python for data related tasks and Machine Learning.

## Data

The data is from [Kaggle -> Myopia Study](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mscgeorges/myopia-study) by GeorgePapa.

## Process

I was tasked with demonstrating my understanding of Python by using it to do EDA and Data Preparation before proceding with doing the Model Training.
  
The Jupyter Notebook showcases the different steps and processes that was done and the various model training and evaluation done.
Hyperparameter fine-tuning was also done to get the model as ideal as possible.

## Conclusion

The Random Forest Model was chosen due to the higher Recall score, which was important as I preferred to keep the number of False Negatives low to ensure maximum detection.
